The fixed salary of the Chief Actuary is comparable to the Mayor and other high ranking officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government employee with the single highest total payroll is Chief Marine Engineer, Pavel Kotelevich. Pavel’s total payroll is $697,052.01. This amount includes his base salary per annum and overtime wages paid. Since Pavel had over 1000 hours of overtime hours, he has received substantial overtime wages despite making a fixed salary of 169,520 dollars in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Correction has the most overtime hours recorded compared to any other agency. The results show that James Inernicola has one of the highest overtime hours recorded, 3692.90 hours. We can assume that the Department of Correction allocates a part of it’s budget to overtime wages for the police force. Therefore, the city’s payroll must also allocate a part of it’s budget for overtime expenses in large department’s like the Department of Correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Districting Commission has on record one of the highest average annual payroll recorded at $158,699.67 in 2014. This result conveys how the agency allocates this amount each year in their budget to pay each employee wages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of ED Pedagogical has the highest recorded number of employees on payroll of over 100,000 employees employed per year. The city payroll must allocate a part of it’s budget to the wages and hiring expenses of this agency and other agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fire Department has the largest average overtime usage compared to the average regular hours recorded at 346.40 hours. Similar to the Department of Correction, the Fire Department has to allocate a part of it’s budget to overtime wages of it’s firefighter workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average salary of employees that work outside of the 5 NYC boroughs is little over $100,000.00. This means that the taxpayer monies that fund these jobs are not being spent in the NYC market or economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth rate from 2014 to 2024 is approximately 46.86%. This is the percentage increase in the total payroll from 2014 to 2024, a 10 year span. This means that NYC’s aggregate wage increases are on track to meet 50% in the coming years"

This data forces us to look at the way in which taxpayer monies are spent on highly ranked offcials like Mr. Adams and how it compares to the regular city employees.\n#Conclusion from the table\n\nPoint 2: Questions about City Payroll Data\nThese questions help us identify…1\n\nWhich job title has the highest base rate of pay? (If needed, assume a standard 2000 hour work year and no overtime.)\nWhich individual & in what year had the single highest city total payroll (regular and overtime combined)?\nWhich individual worked the most overtime hours in this data set?\nWhich agency has the highest average total annual payroll (base and overtime pay per employee)?\nWhich agency has the most employees on payroll in each year?\nWhich agency has the highest overtime usage (compared to regular hours)?\nWhat is the average salary of employees who work outside the five boroughs? (That is, whose work_location_borough is not one of the five counties.)\nHow much has the city’s aggregate payroll grown over the past 10 years?\n\n##Policy 1: Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level ##Many governments require that the no subordinate employee be paid more than the chief executive (mayor, governor, president)\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\nTotal Mayoral Pay For each Fiscal Year\n\n\nTotal Payroll of Employees Paid More than the Mayor\n\n\nTotal Savings if the Mayor’s Salary Had Been the Cap\n\n\nAgencies and job tilites that would be affected the most\n\n\nImpact on city payroll\n\nHow the total payroll expenses would have changed if that policy had been in place historically?\n\n\n\nStaffing adjustments required to implement Policy 1\n\n\nMy Recommendation to the CATS commissioners on whether this policy should be adopted.\n##Policy 2: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime ### A major driver of payroll expenditures is the “1.5x” premium associated with overtime work. That is, it may be cheaper to hire two employees to each work 30 hours to complete a task than to hire one employee to work 40 regular hours and 20 overtime hours to complete the same task.\n\n\nFindings:\n\nTotal Overtime Hours and Pay by Agency and Job Title\n\n\nTotal Savings by Converting Overtime to Regular Hours by Agency and Job Title\n\n\nAggregate Savings by Agency\n\n\n\nImpact on city payroll\n\nHow the total payroll expenses would have changed if that policy had been in place historically?\n\n\n\nStaffing adjustments required to implement Policy 1\n\n\nMy Recommendation to the CATS commissioners on whether this policy should be adopted.\nBased on my findings above, I reccomend the CATS commissioner to adopt this policy.\n##Policy 3: My Policy Proposal - Combining A Decrease in Hourly Employees and Policy 2 ### Findings: Based on my analysis on the data above the City of New York spends the mosy money by tracking the overtime hours of the employees. The city should hire more employees to reduce the overtime hours, but also decrease the amount of hourly employees they hire. This will allow the eorkload to be spread out amoungst the full time employees with a fixed per Annumm salary and the city will save money in the long run becuase they will not have a large part time workforce to pay overtime wages."

The following findings showcase the results of capping all employee wages at the Mayoral Level.\n\nTotal Mayoral Pay For each Fiscal Year\nThe following table displays the salary of the Mayor Eric L Adams from 2014 to 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Payroll of Employees Paid More than the Mayor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the data displayed in the table, there are over 90 employees who make more than the Mayor Eric L Adams each fiscal year. This table allows us to conclude that fixed salaries are not based on title in the NYC government. Therefore, capping the salary at the mayoral level may be feasible given that the position holds no weight in payroll.\n\n\nTotal Savings if the Mayor’s Salary is the Limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the table above, the total savings generated each year by capping employee salary based on the Mayor’s Salary does not exceed $200,000.\n\n\nAgencies and positions that would be affected the most by this policy\nThe following table displays only the top earning employees of each fiscal year who would be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this table above, over 90 employees will be affected by the adoption of this policy.2 The Commission may need to consider the affects this would have on the employees who believe their salary is correct for the workload and position they have.\n\n\nRecommendation to the CATS commissioners on whether this policy should be adopted.\nBased on findings above, we do not recommend the CATS Commissioners to adopt this policy because the total savings generated by capping employee salary based on the Mayor’s Salary does not exceed $200,000 regardless of the year. In addition, the city would lose 102,793.00 if this policy was enacted in 2022. This policy would affected a large part of the city workforce, which may cause turnover rates to skyrocket."
