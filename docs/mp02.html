<p><br><br> The following code imports the National Transit Database (NTD) data for analysis. The data includes information on energy consumption, service, and transit modes for various agencies. The data is cleaned and processed to calculate emissions, normalize emissions to transit usage, and categorize emissions based on specific criteria. The data is then analyzed to identify the winners of the GTA IV Green Transit Awards.<br><br></p>

<p><br><br> ### Data Import for the NTD Service Data</p>
<p>The following code imports the National Transit Database (NTD) Service data for analysis. The data includes information on transit service, unlinked passenger trips, and passenger miles for various agencies. The data is cleaned and processed to calculate emissions, normalize emissions to transit usage, and categorize emissions based on specific criteria. The data is then analyzed to identify the winners of the GTA IV Green Transit Awards.<br><br></p>

<p><br><br> ### Calculate Emissions and Normalize Emissions to Transit Usage</p>
<p>The following code calculates emissions based on the NTD Energy data and normalizes emissions to transit usage.<br><br></p>
<p>The first step was to merge the three datasets: NTD Service, NTD Energy, and EIA SEP Report. The emissions were then calculated based on the energy sources used by the transit agencies. The emissions were normalized to transit usage and categorized based on specific criteria.<br><br></p>

<p><br><br> ### Agency-Level Emissions Analysis</p>
<p>To create this analysis, the total emissions, emissions per UPT, and emissions per passenger mile were computed at the agency level. The emissions were then categorized based on specific criteria. The analysis identified the greenest transit agency based on the lowest emissions per UPT.<br><br></p>
<p>The range for the categorization of emissions per UPT and emissions per passenger mile was as follows: <br><br> - Small: Less than 2 <br><br> - Medium: Between 2 and 4 <br><br> - Large: Greater than 4<br><br></p>

<p><br><br> ### Highest Electrification per Agency</p>
<p>The following code computes the percentage of electrification for each agency based on the energy sources used. The analysis identifies the agency with the highest percentage of electrification and displays the result in an interactive table.<br><br></p>
<p>From the data table, we concluded that the City of Portland - Portland Streetcar has the highest percentage of electrification.<br><br></p>

<p><br><br> ### Data Visualization for Transit Agencies by Size Category</p>
<p>The ggplot2 library was used to create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of transit agencies by size category. The agencies were categorized based on their total UPT size into small, medium, and large categories. The bar chart provides a visual representation of the distribution of agencies by size category.<br><br></p>
<p>From the chart we can see that most agencies fall into the “Large” category, followed by the “Medium” category, and a few agencies in the “Small” category.Despite this the small agencies are equally the best and worst when it comes to sustainablity practices. <br><br></p>

<p><br><br> ### Conclusion Based on the analysis of the National Transit Database (NTD) Energy and Service data, the winners of the GTA IV Green Transit Awards have been identified. The awards recognize the transit agencies with the lowest emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT) and the highest electrification percentage. The analysis also categorizes transit agencies by size and identifies the best small, medium, and large agencies based on emissions per UPT. The results provide valuable insights into the environmental performance of transit agencies and highlight the efforts of the greenest and most sustainable transit providers in the United States.<br><br></p>
