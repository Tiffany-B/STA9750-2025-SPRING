<p>The Department of Correction has the most overtime hours recorded compared to any other agency. The results show that James Inernicola has one of the highest overtime hours recorded, 3692.90 hours. We can assume that the Department of Correction allocates a part of it’s budget to overtime wages for the police force. <em>Therefore, the city’s payroll must also allocate a part of it’s budget for overtime expenses in large department’s like the Department of Correction.</em></p>

<p>Based on the data displayed in the table, there are over <em>90 employees</em> who make more than the Mayor Eric L Adams each fiscal year. This table allows us to conclude that fixed salaries are not based on title in the NYC government. Therefore, capping the salary at the mayoral level may be feasible given that the position holds no weight in payroll.</p>

<p>Based on findings above, we do not recommend the CATS Commissioners to adopt this policy because the total savings generated by capping employee salary based on the Mayor’s Salary does not exceed $200,000 regardless of the year. In addition, the city would lose <strong>102,793.00</strong> if this policy was enacted in 2022. This policy would affected a large part of the city workforce, which may cause turnover rates to skyrocket.</p>

<p>According to this table, there are over 27,000 positions where overtime hours are logged in each agency every fiscal year. The agencies may benefit from a reduction in the workforce due to the millions spent every year to fund the overtime of these positions.</p>

<p>The correlation between employee count and overtime hours is 0.6179. Therefore, as employee hiring increases the amount of overtime hours will also increase. This suggests that hiring more employees <strong>could</strong> increase overtime expenses.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-based-on-full-analysis-of-dataset">Conclusion based on full analysis of dataset:</h4>
<p>Based on my analysis of the data set, the City of New York spends most of it’s money on overtime expenses of the employees. The City should hire more employees to reduce the overtime hours, but also decrease the amount of hourly employees they hire. This has two advantages for the City Payroll. First, it will allow the workload to be spread out amount the full time employees with a fixed per Annual salary. Second, the City will save money in the long term because it will not have a large part time workforce to pay overtime wages.</p>
