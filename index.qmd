Hi! I'm Stephanie. I'm a New York native who has lived in two of NYC's boroughs. I currently live in Nassau County, Long Island. I graduated from Muhlenberg College with a Bachelor of Arts in Finance. I am pursuing a master's degree in business analytics because I would like to become proficient in data analysis and software tools. In addition, I am invested in learning how to use data to craft compelling stories that influence insights and decision-making.
